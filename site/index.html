                            <div class="index_pargraph" id="index_paragraph_1">Yaddle, also known as "The One Below", was a renowned Jedi Master, who went on to serve the Jedi High Council for over a century before her death in 26 BBY during a peacekeeping mission to Mawan. A member of the same species as fellow Councilor Yoda, but about half his age, Yaddle trained dozens of Padawans in her time as a Jedi Master, including Oppo Rancisis, who would later join Yaddle on the Jedi Council, and the brash and overconfident Empatojayos Brand. After completing Brand's training, Yaddle did not take another apprentice, as she was almost five hundred years old when Brand passed the Jedi Trials for Knighthood.</div>

                            <div class="index_pargraph" id="index_paragraph_2">During her time as a Jedi, Yaddle represented the Jedi Council on many off world missions. She went to Asmeru in 33 BBY with a group of Jedi including Vergere, Saesee Tiin, Depa Billaba and Qui-Gon Jinn, as well as his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi, where they were attacked by Nebula Front members, but managed to defeat them. Yaddle was also part of a six-member team of Jedi Councilors sent on a peacekeeping mission to Malastare, to mediate a meeting between the Lannik government and Red Iaro rebels. After being attacked by Red Iaro terrorists, Yaddle saved the lives of her fellow Council members, and, although the mission was in the end unsuccessful, there were no Jedi casualties. Yaddle's final mission took place in 26 BBY. She, along with Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker, were sent to Mawan to attempt to restore peace to the lawless world. Yaddle sacrificed her life to save the people of Mawan, using the Force to absorb a deadly chemical weapon unleashed by Granta Omega. She was then given a traditional Jedi funeral back at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and was succeeded by Shaak Ti on the Jedi High Council.</div>
